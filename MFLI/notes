Problems to report to Zurich:
1. USB interface is called 1GbE
2. Signal output:
- enable autorange
- turn on Generator 1
- set amplitude to 1V
Now, I would expect that after turning generator off and on it will go back to the previous state. But here is what actually happens:
- turn OFF Generator 1
-- Autorange is triggered and set to 10mV
-- Amplitude of Generator 1 automatically jumps to 10mV
- Turn ON Generator 1
-- Amplitude is 10mV
